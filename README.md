FACT-Finder-PHP-Library
=======================

the new fancy reworked library to access FACT-Finder with php

Motivation & Goals
------------------

- no more support of multiple FACT-Finder versions and interfaces at once, as legacy codes and all the inheritance makes it too complicated
- use the recommended interface to FF instead of providing every possability 
- make the api more clear, transparent and better accessable to give the developers more power influencing the requests to FACT-Finder
