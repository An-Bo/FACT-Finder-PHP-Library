FACT-Finder-PHP-Library
=======================

This is a complete rewrite of and will replace the old
[FACT Finder PHP Library](https://github.com/FACT-Finder/FACT-Finder-PHP-Framework).

**The project is currently in beta status while we build a [demo](https://github.com/FACT-Finder/FACT-Finder-PHP-Library-Demo) to showcase how the library should be used.**

**Please do not use it in productive code yet unless you know what you are doing!**


Motivation & Goals
------------------

- No longer support multiple FACT-Finder versions and interfaces at once, as
  legacy code and deep inheritance trees make the project increasingly hard to
  maintain.
- Use the recommended FACT-Finder interface (JSON) instead of providing every
  possibility.
- Make the API clearer and more easily accessible to give developers more
  control over the requests to FACT-Finder.

Documentation ToDos
-------------------

- PHPDoc of the code
- General documentation in GitHub wiki
